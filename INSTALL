Installing and using your own ARIS Server



INSTALLING THE SERVER

1. Copy the "server" derectory and it's contents to your web server, renaming it whatever you wish. 
For this example we will say you called it "aris_server" and it is available at http://myserver.com/aris_server

2. Create a schema in your database for ARIS to use and assign it a username and password. 
For this example we will say you called the schema "aris_schema" and game it the user "aris_username"

3. Copy aris_server/services/aris/config.class.template to aris_server/services/aris/config.class

4. Edit config.class to match your database configuration from above.

5. Import the aris_server/aris_db_install.sql file into your new schema. 
You can do this via commandline: mysql -u aris_username -p aris_schema < aris_db_install


BUILDING THE CLIENT

You really shouldn't need to rebuild the client unless you want to change the default server it points to. 

That is done by editing the root.plist file in the Settings Bundle.
