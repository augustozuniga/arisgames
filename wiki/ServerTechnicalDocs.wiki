ARIS uses [http://amfphp.sourceforge.net/ AMFPHP] for a simple PHP/MySQL development environment that provides JSON, AMF, REST and RPC web services. 

While many of the directories within the server folder ar AMFPHP related, ARIS services reside within the server/services/aris directory. 

A description of each service can be found in the [http://arisgames.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/serviceDocs/index.html ARIS Services documentation]
