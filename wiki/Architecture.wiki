#summary High level description of the components and architecture of the ARIS client, server and authoring tool

= Introduction =

ARIS is actually a collection of 3 pieces of software that work together. When a feature is added to one, it often will require all three to be updated, so technically each release of the ARIS client is packaged with the server and authoring tool it is guaranteed to work with.

= ARIS Components =

  * *The Server* stores the database in a set of MySQL Tables for all ARIS games, authors and players. It uses a library called AMFPHP to provide AMF and JSON access to a set of services for the client and author to interface with.
  * *The iPhone Client* is built in the iPhone SDK and is where the games are actually played. It talks with the server to download game information and update the player's actions/state over a JSON call.
  * *The Authoring Tool* is built in FLEX 3.5 and provides authors with an interface to create and modify games on ARIS.It communicates with the server over AMF to create items, locations, set requirements, etc.
