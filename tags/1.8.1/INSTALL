Installing and using your own ARIS Server



INSTALLING THE SERVER

1. Checkout the "server" derectory and it's contents to your web server, renaming it whatever you wish. 
For this example we will say you called it "aris_server" and it is available at http://myserver.com/aris_server

	svn checkout https://arisgames.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/server aris_server

2. Create a schema in your database for ARIS to use and assign it a username and password. 
For this example we will say you called the schema "aris_schema" and game it the user "aris_username"

3. Copy aris_server/services/aris/config.class.template to aris_server/services/aris/config.class

4. Edit config.class to match your database configuration from above.

5. Import the aris_server/aris_db_install.sql file into your new schema. 

	mysql -u aris_username -p aris_schema < aris_db_install.sql

6. Run the DB update script to make sure everything is up to snuff (this might produce a lot of errors, but you shouldn't need to mind them.

	http://myserver.com/aris_server/json.php/v1.games.upgradeGameDatabases/0

7. Set file permissions so that the web server can write to the gamedata directory

	chmod -R apache:apache aris_server
	chmod -R 775 aris_server
	chmod -R u+s gamedata
