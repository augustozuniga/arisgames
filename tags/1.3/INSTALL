Installing and using your own ARIS Server



INSTALLING THE SERVER

1. Copy the "server" derectory and it's contents to your web server, renaming it whatever you wish. 
For this example we will say you called it "aris_server" and it is available at http://myserver.com/aris_server

2. Create a schema in your database for ARIS to use and assign it a username and password. 
For this example we will say you called the schema "aris_schema" and game it the user "aris_username"

3. Copy aris_server/services/aris/config.class.template to aris_server/services/aris/config.class

4. Edit config.class to match your database configuration from above.

5. Import the aris_server/aris_db_install.sql file into your new schema. 
You can do this via commandline: mysql -u aris_username -p aris_schema < aris_db_install.sql




BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE EDITOR

1. Edit editor/src/main/resources/services-config.xml to point to the server you created above

2. Edit editor/src/main/flex/org/arisgames/editor/util/AppConstants.as changing 
APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT_UPLOAD_SERVER_URL to the server created above and 
APPLICATION_ENVIRONMENT_GOOGLEMAP_KEY to your google map api key

3. Download the Maven 2.2.1 binary, then follow the instructions on installation from the bottom of the same page.
Make sure to take the optional step described in the install doc to set the memory size to 2048 (eg. add "export JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx2048M" and "export MAVEN_OPTS=-Xmx2048M"  to your terminal/shell launch script)

4. Change directory to the 'editor' directory and run 'mvn clean package'

5. If everything runs correctly, it should download a bunch of packages and create a "target" directory where the build will sit.

6. Copy target/editor-1.0.swf into target/classes

7. Rename target/classes/editor-1.0.swf to ARISEditor.swf

8. Copy the "target" directory and it's contents to your web server, renaming it whatever you wish. 
For this example we will say you called it "aris_editor" and it is available at http://myserver.com/aris_editor

9. Open http://myserver.com/aris_editor in a web browser



BUILDING THE CLIENT

You really shouldn't need to rebuild the client unless you want to change the default server it points to. 

That is done by editing the root.plist file in the Settings Bundle.
